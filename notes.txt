FIX 500 request error

1. computational power used
    -technically i dont need to run tf on the same person twice
    -it works like this now so i get data on all users not just matches
        -thinking....

2 Get better stats file
    -most done but need to make it better
    -maybe return percentile, data is normally distributed
    -maybe i should get the count of faces?

3. known bugs
    - unicode bio causes tokinzation issues
    - cant unicode respond with emojis easily w/o formatting issues
    - get all faces in photos
        - possible to find the right user?????
