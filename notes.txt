1. Game changing TODOS which will never be completed
    - find more efficent way to check for new matches
        - maybe i can get notifs or something
    - recomplie TF for AVXM FMA

2. Minor Stuff
    - working on the graph file right now
        - combine all plots into a subplot
    - clean up stats file and auto_mess
        - compactify code
    - TF and TB data is not normally distributed :(
        - this could be a sampling issue or a tb/tf issue

3. Major Stuff
    - beat the transfer learned inception model accuracy
        -inception v3 model 2kish training = 92% - 4k steps
        -my cnn = 4 conv layers, adam optimizer, relu activation - ascending filters
            -256 batch/5 epochs - 10k train/2k validation = 78%
            -256 batch/5 epochs - 20k train/4k valid = training
    - need a slave to organize all faces and clean
        - somewhat sorted at 30k photos right now

4. BUGs
    - the CV2 Resize bug. Cant figure out why resize fails with (-215 Assertion error)
        - Size empty issue
    - cnn new_data=True needs to be called twice?
        - prob a filewriter error
        - time.sleep() would solve
    - unicode bio not tokenizing 
        - its not causeing issues but need a lexicon containing unicode chars for TB
        - maybe can just assign most used emoji's a value

5. NN training
    - clean the data by hand(remove bad faces)
    - get the hyper-parameters down
    - try staring from 16 filters in block1
