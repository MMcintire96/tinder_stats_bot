1. fix the db lock issue
    -asynchronous adding to two different tables not supported????
        -this could be done by creating 2 dbs? one for likes one for matches

2. computational power used
    -technically i dont need to run tf on the same person twice
    -it works like this now so i get data on all users not just matches
        -thinking....

3. Write the stats file
    -get the avg (pol, subj, happy, neutral)
    -get the std/variance (pol, subj, happy, neutral)
    -maybe i should get the count of faces?
    -get avg/std(bio length and photo count)

4. known bugs
    - unicode bio causes tokinzation issues
    - cant unicode respond with emojis easily w/o formatting issues
    - get all faces in photos
        - possible to find the right user?????
