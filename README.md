# tinder_stats_bot

A bot that returns user data for their tinder profile using tensorflow and textblob

coded with love, coffee and Lady Gaga - Shallow

## Run
To run this bot, you need to make the folders
1. user_imgs/
2. match_imgs/
3. happy_imgs/
4. neutral_imgs/
5. db/

you will also need the requirements which I cba to write out

1. Call 'connect.py' and use --help to guide you through it. This will make a creds.txt file for you
2. auto_liker.py will like all users and add their data to the DB 
3. auto_mess.py is the message responder, sends new matches their stats

Currently you need to run auto_mess.py all the time, and it will get http errors - working on a fix

## TODO
read notes.txt if you really care

### Creds

Thank You Mary for tinderpro

1. Pynder by charlie/wolf - slightly modified
2. Tensorflow - Google
3. TextBlob - whoever made it, good job
