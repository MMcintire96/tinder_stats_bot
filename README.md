# tinder_stats_bot

A bot that returns user data for their tinder profile using tensorflow and textblob

Need tinder pro for unlimited likes. Give me money

coded with love, coffee and Lady Gaga - Shallow

## Run
To run this bot, you need to make the folders
1. user_imgs/
2. match_imgs/
3. happy_imgs/
4. neutral_imgs/
5. db/

you will also need the requirements which I cba to write out

Call 'connect.py' and use --help to guide you through it. This will make a creds.txt file for you
auto_liker.py will like all users and add their data to the DB 
auto_mess.py is the message responder, it waits for a specific message 'DATA' and then returns stats

## TODO
    read the notes.txt if you really care

### Creds
Pynder by charlie/wolf - slightly modified
Tensorflow - Google
TextBlob - whoever made it, good job
